Description: commandline slicer program for 3-D printers
 3-D printers need a toolpath for printing, while what is usually distributed
 is a 3-D model.  A slicer programs converts a model to a toolpath, with user
 defined settings for options such as infill density and printing speed.
 .
 This slicer is the commandline backend of Cura.
