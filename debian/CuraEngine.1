.SH NAME
CuraEngine \- slicing engine for Cura
.SH DESCRIPTION
The CuraEngine is a C++ console application for 3D printing GCode generation. It has been made as a better and faster alternative to the old Skeinforge engine.
.PP
The CuraEngine is pure C++ and uses Clipper from http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php
Furthermore it depends on libArcus by Ultimaker, which can be found at http://github.com/Ultimaker/libArcus
.PP
This is just a console application for GCode generation. For a full graphical application look at https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura which is the graphical frontend for CuraEngine.
.PP
The CuraEngine can be used separately or in other applications. Feel free to add it to your application. But please take note of the License.
